## Testing with the Arrange, Act, Assert Principles

The Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) principles are a helpful guideline for writing clear and effective unit tests. These principles break down the testing process into three distinct phases: Arrange, Act, and Assert. Let's look at each of these phases in detail:

### Arrange

In this phase, you set up the test environment. This includes configuring any necessary state, creating relevant objects or variables, and preparing any other necessary preconditions for the test.

Examples of activities in the Arrange phase:
- Set up the initial state of the system under test.
- Create instances of relevant objects.
- Configure test data.

### Act

In this phase, you perform the action or behavior being tested. This involves calling specific methods or functions and executing the code expected to produce a certain result.

Examples of activities in the Act phase:
- Call the function or method being tested.
- Execute the action being tested.
- Capture any result or output from the action.

### Assert

In this phase, you verify that the observed behavior matches the expected behavior. You compare the results of the action with the expected results and ensure that the test was successful.

Examples of activities in the Assert phase:
- Verify that the results of the action are correct.
- Compare expected results with observed results.
- Confirm that test expectations are met.

### Example of a Test using the Arrange, Act, Assert Principles

```javascript
// Example of a unit test using the Arrange, Act, Assert principles

// Arrange
const value1 = 3;
const value2 = 7;
const expectedSum = 10;

// Act
const result = sum(value1, value2);

// Assert
if (result === expectedSum) {
  console.log('Test Passed: Sum function adds two numbers correctly.');
} else {
  console.error(`Test Failed: Expected ${expectedSum}, but received ${result}.`);
}
```
